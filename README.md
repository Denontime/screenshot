# A simple screenshot tool #

A simple screenshot tool writes in python with pyQt5.

You can take some simple changes after taking a screenshot without opening an image editor.

## How to use

Because I have not completed it, it has only a few functions.

Till now, you can draw rectangle, ellipse, arrow and line in 3 different sizes and 14 kinds of colors. With development, it will support user defined color and size.

Before starting, you should make sure you have python and pyqt5 installed.

1. git clone https://github.com/SeptemberHX/screenshot.git
2. cd ./src
3. python ./screenshot.py

For now, after you selecting an area and editing, just press CTRL-S to save it, press ESC to exit. Then you will find a png file named "test.png" in your src directory.
